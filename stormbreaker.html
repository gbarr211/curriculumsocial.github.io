        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Innovative EdTech Solution for Southeast Asia's Mobile Families - Curriculum Social</p>
        
        <p>Dear [Stormbreaker Ventures Team],</p>
        
        <p>I'm reaching out given your focus on transformative education models in Southeast Asia, particularly your investments in companies like Conicle that are reimagining learning delivery.</p>
        
        <p>I'm Greg, the founder of Curriculum Social, a hybrid education platform launching in Koh Samui that combines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI-powered adaptive learning</li>
            <li>Human teaching expertise (including parent-teachers)</li>
            <li>Community-based social learning</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We're addressing a critical gap for digital nomads and expatriate families seeking quality, consistent education that fosters both academic excellence and social development. Our unique matching system connects families based on educational values within a defined geographic radius.</p>
        
        <p>With your expertise in EdTech innovation in Thailand, I'd value the opportunity to discuss how Curriculum Social aligns with Stormbreaker's vision for transformative education models.</p>
        
        <p>Would you be available for a 20-minute conversation next week to explore potential synergies?</p>
        
        <p>Best regards,<br>
        Greg<br>

        <h3>Curriculum Social: Revolutionizing Education for Mobile Families</h3>
        
        <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Mobile families (digital nomads, expatriates) struggle with educational continuity, community connection, and quality standards. International schools are expensive and inflexible, while homeschooling lacks social components.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Learning:</strong> Personalized curriculum adapted to each student's needs</li>
            <li><strong>Human Teaching:</strong> Expert instruction including a parent-teacher model with tuition credits</li>
            <li><strong>Community Learning:</strong> In-person activities in verified venues with proprietary matching system</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Market Opportunity:</strong> $12.7B global EdTech market with significant growth in Southeast Asia. 35% increase in digital nomad families since 2020.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Business Model:</strong> Multi-tiered subscription ($100-500/month) with parent-teacher tuition credits and venue partnerships.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Traction:</strong> Launching in Koh Samui with 15-25 family beta program in Q3 2025.</p>
